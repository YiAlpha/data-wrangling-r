# HOMEWORK 2

## Goal: Data Wrangling

## Featured Package(s)

- Tidyverse

## Difficulties I come with

- **Know about the data**: at first I include "Binge drinking prevalence among women aged 18–44 years" but can not find "Binge drinking prevalence among men aged 18–44 years", so I spend a lot time find how to get a variable named `binge_male`.
- **Transform to tidy data**: by exmaining the shape of data, I know I should use `spread()`, but long time after I realized I should also use `union()`. Reallife data usually requires more than one step to clean.

## Extra Things I have learned

- [ ] update my R and R studio version

- [ ] use `prettydoc` package to generate a neat html report

- [ ] practice, practice, practice
