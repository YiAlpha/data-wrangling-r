## 1. Create R Markdown Document


## 2. Get some data


```r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("rudeboybert/fivethirtyeight")
```

Load `fivethirtyeight` package, I choose `college_grad_student` dataset-- The raw data behind the story "The Economic Guide To Picking A College Major" on [fivethirtynight websit](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-economic-guide-to-picking-a-college-major/)


Manually create a small table for your dataframe with two columns: variable name and variable description. Include a few variables in the table.

```r
name <- c('major_code',
           'major',
           'major_category',
           'grad_total',
           'grad_sample_size',
           'grad_employed',
           'grad_employed_fulltime_yearround',
           'grad_unemployed',
           'grad_unemployment_rate')



decription <- c('Major code, FO1DP in ACS PUMS',
'Major description',
'Category of major from Carnevale et al',
'Total number of people with major',
'Sample size (unweighted) of full-time, year-round ONLY (used for earnings)',
'Number employed (ESR == 1 or 2)',
'Employed at least 50 weeks (WKW == 1) and at least 35 hours (WKHP >= 35)',
'Number unemployed (ESR == 3)',
'Unemployed / (Unemployed + Employed)')
des <- data.frame(name, decription)
names(des) <- c("Variable Name", "Varibale Description")
knitr::kable(des)
```
