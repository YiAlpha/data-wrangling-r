# HOMEWORK 6

##Goal: Working with Strings

## Featured Package(s)

- `stringr`
- `lubridate`
- `reshape2`

## Difficulties I come with

- **Dealing with date and time data**: using `lubridate`
- **Extract train information**: step by step using `str_remove` and `str_replace`
- **Calculate percent of subgroup in group**: use `transmutate` or `mutate(subgroup, percent = n/sum(n))`

## Extra Things I have learned

- [ ] Regex needs practice.
