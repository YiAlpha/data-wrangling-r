Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.\n\nWhen you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:\n\n```{r}\nsummary(cars)\n```\n\n## Including Plots\n\nYou can also embed plots, for example:\n\n```{r, echo=FALSE}\nplot(pressure)\n```\n\nNote that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.\n\n## Add other types of code with `engine`\n\nBy default, your R notebook chunks will be run using R. However, it's entirely possible to write chunks that use other engines to execute. For instance, you can add some Python to your notebook:\n\n```{r engine='python'}\nfriends = ['john', 'pat', 'gary', 'michael']\nfor i, name in enumerate(friends):\n    print \"iteration {iteration} is {name}\".format( \n    iteration=i, name=name)\n```\n\n## In-line Latex and R code\n\nYou can convert the temperature unit from Kelvin to Celsius with the formula\n\n$$ celsius = kelvin - 273.15 $$\nAnd you can convert the result to Fahrenheit with the formula \n\n$$ fahrenheit = celsius \\times \\frac{9}{5} + 32 $$\n\n```{r, echo = FALSE, results = 'hide'}\nexample_kelvin <- 282.15\n```\n\nFor example, `r example_kelvin` degrees Kelvin corresponds to `r example_kelvin - 273.15` degrees Celsius.\n\n## Interactive Visualizations\n\nWe can use interactive features as well. Let's load the required packages first. \n\n```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dygraphs)\nlibrary(leaflet)\n```\n\n### HTML Widgets\n\nIf your R analysis involves interactive components, you're probably already familiar with the `htmlwidgets` library. These, too, are supported in the notebook. Run this chunk to see an interactive graph:\n\n```{r}\ndygraph(nhtemp, main = \"New Haven Temperatures\") %>% \n  dyRangeSelector(dateWindow = c(\"1920-01-01\", \"1960-01-01\"))\n```\n\n## Running Code\n\nOne of the goals of the notebook is to provide a seamless environment for interacting with R -- that is, you shouldn't need to reach for the console, even though chunks send code there. To help you see the progress of your chunk -- that is, which lines have been executed and which haven't -- RStudio draws an indicator in the editor gutter. Try running this chunk:\n\n```{r, echo=TRUE}\nSys.sleep(1); runif(3)\nSys.sleep(1); runif(3)\nSys.sleep(1); runif(3)\nSys.sleep(1); runif(3)\nSys.sleep(1); runif(3)\n```\n\n### Stepwise Execution\n\nSometimes you may want to run portions of your chunk rather than the whole thing. That's just fine too. Try using *Ctrl+Enter* (OS X: *Cmd+Enter*) to run this chunk line by line.\n\n```{r linewise}\ncities <- read.csv(\"cities.csv\")\ncities\nleaflet(cities) %>% \n  addTiles() %>%\n  addCircles(lng = ~Long, lat = ~Lat, weight = 1,\n    radius = ~sqrt(Pop) * 30, popup = ~City)\n```\n\n### Errors\n\nSometimes your code will generate errors. Here's an example:\n\n```{r errors, error=TRUE}\n# Source a file that doesn't exist\nsource(\"missing.R\")\n```\n\nNotice that the line that caused the error is highlighted, and you can see the error's traceback, just as you can in the RStudio console. If an error occurs while you're running chunks, the error will cause the notebook to stop running, and the cursor will scroll to the point where the error occurred.\n\n## R Notebooks\n\nThis file is a [R Notebook](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/r_notebooks.html). It is a great way to share your analysis with others because it contains both the html output as well as the .Rmd file with the script to generate that output.\n\n### Saving and Sharing\n\nA notebook's source code is always in an `.Rmd` file. Whenever you save it, a sidecar `.nb.html` file is generated. This file contains a rendered copy of the notebook itself. No special viewer is required.\n\nIt also contains a copy of the notebook's source `.Rmd` file.\n\nTo look at the `.nb.html` file, click *Preview* in the RStudio editor toolbar. This is a fundamental difference between notebooks and other R Markdown documents; pressing this button doesn't actually cause any of your code to run, it just shows you the HTML file already prepared. It will automatically update whenever you save the `.Rmd` file.\n\nIf you open the `.nb.html` file in a web browser, you'll see an option to download the source. You can also open an `.nb.html` file in RStudio; when you do this, RStudio will automatically extract the `.Rmd` file and outputs inside it and open the file in the notebook editor.\n\n### Notebooks as R Markdown Documents\n\nA notebook is also an R Markdown document. Try changing the YAML header in this document so that `html_document` is the first option, then clicking `Knit` (or just pulling down the *Preview*) menu. You could also create a PDF from the notebook, a Word document, or even a dashboard. \n\n### Publishing\n\nThe notebook output is a html file with is easily shareable and can be open in any modern browser - so no R Studio required on the receiving end. R Studio also offers a service called [RPubs](http://rpubs.com/) which let's you publish documents (and shiny apps) so you can share them with others via a link.\n\nTo do so, click the **publish** button in RStudio and enter a few things (like title and description) to publish the document (and make it publicly available). You need to sign up for RPubs beforehand to be able to do this quickly.\n\n## Other output formats\n\nR Notebooks are also R Markdown documents and as such we can choose other output formats. Try to knit the document to html and pdf by choose the down arrow next to the preview button.\n\n",
